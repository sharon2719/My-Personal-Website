            <p>Before we get to the subject title, understanding who Abel is of great importance.<br>
                <br>
               <b>Who is Abel?</b> <br>
                Abel is a character in Trevor Noah’s book, a mechanic at Yeoville in Mighty Mechanics<br>
                garage. He is Andrew’s biological father and Trevor’s step-father. He is married to <br>
                Trevor’s mum Patricia Nombuyiselo. He is an abusive and alcoholic father and husband.<br>
                He is a man who helps anyone in distress. He is the guy that chases the robbers when<br>
                an alarm is raised.<br>
                <br>
                Trevor’s mom meets up with Abel and forms a close relationship with him. Trevor notices <br>
                that they are now spending more time with Abel.His mom hits him with the “We are getting married ”<br>
                bomb on him but he doesn’t like the idea.Everything else changes when Abel takes control of the home.<br>
                <br>

                A year later, after Andrew’s birth, they travel to Tzaneen in Gazankulu to present his <br>
                son and wife to his family.Trevor comse to understand that this is a patriarchal society<br>
                and the African traditions of men’s roles and women’s roles are held highly.In Africa,<br>
                a man is the head of the home and a woman’s job is to please her husband and follow the <br>
                rules set by him and the society. These type of men like to be with women who are free and independent<br>
                and live by their rules. They are like lions who wait on an antelope until it falls into its claws.<br>
                <br>
                When they get or “acquire” such women they feel like they have conquered the world and make <br>
                them bow to their rules. They do not want women who follow their rules but want those that are<br>
                always contending with them so that they can prove their superiority.I think that the women that<br>
                we have in our society today,  cannot allow themselves to be subservient to men in their lives <br>
                simply because they feel like their independence is being threatened and do not want to be <br>
                “put in a cage”.Women have been bound by rules that they have to act in a certain way and do<br>
                what society dictates.This book will illustrate how a world run by a woman looks like.<br>

                <h2>Finding joy in the darkest of times</h2>
                <h5>Born A Crime Book Review 002,9th,May,2021</h5>

                <p>
                    It is always good to find joy even in the darkest of times<br>
                    Trevor does a really good job at seeing the good out of everything.<br>
                    In his book, we encounter a series of humorous moments. <br>
                    <br>
                    Humor helped his family to heal.<br>
                    <b><i>“My mom looks at me and she goes, ‘Shhh, Trevor, shhh, don’t cry, baby.’ I say, ‘No, mom,<br>
                    I’m gonna cry, you were shot in the head!’ ‘No, no no, look on the bright side.’ <br>
                    ‘What bright side?’ At least now, because of my nose, you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.”</i></b><br>
                    Even though his mum is hurt by his step-father, they still make fun of the situation they are <br>
                    in and laugh about.<br>
                    <br>
                    Due to the effects of apartheid, Trevor found a way of making new friends by the use of humor.<br>
                    <b><i>“The black kids were fascinated. In South Africa back then, it wasn’t common to find a white person<br>
                    or a colored person who spoke African languages...”</i></b><br>
                    <br>
                    
                    The same sense of humor helped him get out of trouble. One day, Trevor decides to poop in the kitchen <br>
                    simply because he did not want to use the outside toilet. He forgets that his Koko is sitting in the kitchen.<br>
                    He finishes his business despite Koko calling out names several times and thinking that nobody is around. <br>
                    He then throws it in the dustbin and when his mother comes back and Koko narrates the incident to her <br>
                    she calls for a prayer meeting and Trevor is asked to pray. The prayer he makes is so funny.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>“Dear Lord, please protect us, um, you know, from whoever did this but, like, we don’t know what happened<br> 
                    exactly and maybe it was a big misunderstanding and, you know the whole story and, I mean, of course, you <br>
                    know best, Heavenly Father, but maybe this time it wasn’t actually a demon, because who can say for certain,<br>
                    so maybe cut whoever it was a break…”</i></b><br>
                    <br>
                    He was able to get out of trouble when the Zulu boys wanted to harm him and he spoke in their<br>
                    language and they believed he was one of them.<br>
                    <b><i>"...I could here them talking to one another about how they were going to mug me."Asibambe le autie yomlungu.<br>
                    Phuma ngapha ngizoqhamuka ngemuva kwakhe...""</i></b><br>
                    The humor in this book is on another level.
